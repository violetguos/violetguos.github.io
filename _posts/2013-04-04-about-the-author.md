Hi there! I'm Violet. I am currently studying Professional MS in Machine Learning (internship option) at University of Montreal, affiliated with MILA lab. I graduated from University of Toronto Electrical and Computer Engineering program in June 2018. I previously interned software positions with electrical and biomedical research context, and have transitioned into computer science with concentration in data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

What I see in data science:
* agility
* correctness
* performance

I want to be

* vertically integrated
  * programming languages
    * testing
    * goal: learn OCaml
  * web dev
    * how can you build products?
  * reliability
    * how to serve your product
    * how to train your model efficiently
    * how to store your data
  * security
    * how to protect your data (hint: end to end encryption)
  * machine learning
  * data science

* horizontally integrated
  * production
  * design
  * management
  * research and development
