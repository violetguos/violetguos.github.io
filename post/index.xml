      <description>The task of classifying the accent of recorded speech has generally been approached with traditional SVM or UBM-GMM methods (Omar and Pelecanos, 2010; Ge, 2015). However, modern deep learning methods yield the potential to dramatically increase performance. In our report, we train several varieties of Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks on three types of features (MFCC, formant, and raw spectrogram) extracted from North American and British English speech recordings in order to predict the accent of the speaker.</description>

      <description>Introduction The classic algorithm for game playing is to program computers to &amp;ldquo;think&amp;rdquo; like a chess master. However, computers are not good at wholistic reasoning which often involves some philosophical ideas about chess. Instead, artificial intelligence programs a computer to search for the best move out of all moves. Right away, you may think that it is exhaustive search where you look for all the combinations of possible solutions. This is where artificial intelligence comes in and improves that search with heuristics and parallel processing to selectively search for the best move.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this project, I have built a multi-cycle processor&amp;rsquo;s instruction set from scratch.
Technical Details - Programmed a multicycle processor in Verilog on a Altera DE-1 FPGA - Configured a new Assembly language instruction set with Verilog
Lessons Learned In processor or hardware design, unlike computer software, there is no room for uncertainty. For example, a software engineer may put a button in a not so convenient place for no good reason, but it does not hinder the functionality of the app, just harder to navigate.</description>

      <description>Introduction Cybersecurity is a branch of study in computer system and algorithm that aims to provide security to data and programs. The two types of work done are 1. Improve computer system to shield users from attackers 2. Encrypt data so that when the device is compromised, the attacker cannot decrypt user data
The course project is also designed to address these two objective 1. Given a vulnerable system, implement code to attack the system 2.</description>

      <description>Android app to reduce clinic wait time
This is a hackathon project developed outside of school.
PROBLEM Far too many Canadians facing long wait times for health services experience frustration and wonder if our healthcare system is broken. Literature points to a negative impact of wait time on patients&amp;rsquo; perceptions of health care quality, satisfaction and likeability, patients&amp;rsquo; subsequent behavior, and likelihood of recommendations and repeat visits.
HOW IT WORKS Patients with our app, who have booked an appointment can check-in remotely 30 min before their appointment, if theyâ€™re close enough to the medical clinic.</description>
