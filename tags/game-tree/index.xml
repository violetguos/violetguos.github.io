      <description>Introduction The classic algorithm for game playing is to program computers to &amp;ldquo;think&amp;rdquo; like a chess master. However, computers are not good at wholistic reasoning which often involves some philosophical ideas about chess. Instead, artificial intelligence programs a computer to search for the best move out of all moves. Right away, you may think that it is exhaustive search where you look for all the combinations of possible solutions. This is where artificial intelligence comes in and improves that search with heuristics and parallel processing to selectively search for the best move.</description>
